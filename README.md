FreeRez
=======

This simple, easy-to-use Mac application allows you to set any of the supported, unscaled resolutions on your display.  It includes support for multiple monitors, and makes it super easy to set the native resolution on a Retina Display Macbook Pro.

**NOTE**: FreeRez does NOT support retina presets; you must use System Preferences to set these.
